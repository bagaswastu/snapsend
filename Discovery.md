Snapsend is an app that lets you share photos for a limited time and with a limited number of recipients.

## âœ¨ Features:

- Set a timer for your photos to expire
- Photos are deleted after 24 hours if they haven't been opened
- Detects if the user has already viewed the photo, so they can only access it once, even if they use a different browser or incognito mode
- No login required, so you can remain anonymous.
